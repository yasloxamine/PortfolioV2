        <strong class="red-color">KHADDAM,</strong> a mobile app that connects
        users with nearby skilled service providers such as plumbers,
        electricians, painters, and more. This app is built using React Native,
        Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and UI Kitten for the UI. Working on this
        project helped me strengthen my skills in mobile development, secure
        authentication with JWT, and RESTful API integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app supports real-time user login and registration, persistent
        sessions using AsyncStorage, and a dynamic bottom navigation bar that
        adjusts based on authentication status. I also implemented custom
        theming with UI Kitten and integrated a PostgreSQL database for user
        management. I am currently developing this app with the goal of turning
        it into a scalable solution for local service marketplaces.

        by implementing the one provided by CheapShark.

        <strong class="red-color">MOROCCAN HORROR GAME,</strong> This is a
        work-in-progress game created using the Unity Engine for development,
        Blender for 3D modeling, C# for game logic, ambientCG for materials and
        textures, and ZapSplat along with Audacity for sound effects and music.
        I am currently developing this project as a hobby to gain experience as
        a coder, designer, and 3D artist. Through this process, I’m implementing
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C# and adhering to good
        coding practices, which contribute to improved game performance and
        optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept for this project is inspired by a nightmare I once had.
        While I don’t remember the details or the ending of the dream, I’m
        attempting to bring it to life as a 3D Moroccan horror game. Hopefully,
        I’ll give it a happy ending, something I didn’t have in the dream.
        Currently, there is no online demo available yet.

        This rocket game is also a work in progress, and I’m planning to submit
        it to an upcoming Moroccan Game Dev Jam. I’ll redesign it to fit the
        chosen theme for the event.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game is designed for mobile platforms and has been successfully
        tested on an Android Samsung phone, with excellent frame rate
        performance. It was built using the same technologies as my Moroccan
        horror game. Working on this project has significantly enhanced my
        overall knowledge of mobile game development.
